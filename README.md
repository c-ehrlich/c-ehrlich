Hi :)

### Recent side projects (past year or so)

* [micropolis](https://github.com/c-ehrlich/micropolis) - SimCity (1989) ported to TypeScript, running in the browser.
* [trace-amp](https://github.com/c-ehrlich/trace-amp) - OpenTelemetry tracing wrapper for Amp
* [youtube-summarize-extension](https://github.com/c-ehrlich/youtube-summarize-extension) - Summarize YouTube videos to avoid clickbait. This used to work, but YouTube started restricting the closed captions API so no longer does.
* [cjode](https://github.com/c-ehrlich/cjode) - Coding agent similar to Amp (but much worse). The basic agent + subagents work, CLI works, don't expect it to perform anywhere near SOTA. I mostly just built this to better understand how existing agents work.
