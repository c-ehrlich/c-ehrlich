# Hi, Iâ€™m Christopher

Designer and University Lecturer turned Full Stack Developer. 

I like:
* Creating tools
* Teaching / explaining things
* Language learning (as in, spoken languages)
* Type Safety

I'm particularly interested in pushing DX to a new level, empowering developers to create high quality apps and love their tooling instead of having to fight it. I'm on the core team of [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/), and also frequently contribute to other projects such as [tRPC](https://trpc.io/).

I care strongly about improving documentation, and I have also begun creating educational content for these and other projects on both [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ccccjjjjeeee) and written mediums. 

Currently working at Moody's Analytics.
