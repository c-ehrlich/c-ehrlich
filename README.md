# Hi, Iâ€™m Christopher

I'm a university lecturer who was excited about programming as a child but at some point decided to take a different route. During COVID I fell in love once again with programming and decided that this is what I want to do in the future. One of my other hobbies is language learning, so outside of learning modern Web Development I've also been building some language learning tools.

## Technologies I've built projects in:
* Frontend: React + TypeScript, Next.js, Redux, React Query, Zustand
* Backend: Node.js / Express + TypeScript, Django, Django REST Framework
* DB: Prisma 2 with PostgreSQL, Mongoose / Typegoose with MongoDB, Django ORM with PostgreSQL 
* Styling: Material-UI, Styled Components, Mantine
* Testing: Jest, Mocha / Chai
* DevOps: Docker, Deployment to Linux server, Cloud (AWS EC2/RDS/S3, Vercel, Heroku), GitHub Actions for CI/CD
## Currently learning:
* Cypress
## How to reach me:
* ehrlich dot my first name at gmail dot com
